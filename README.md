### Project Title: Spring Boot Microservice Architecture

# Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and implementation of a complete microservice architecture using Spring Boot. The architecture includes two microservices, a Service Registry, an API Gateway.

# Microservices

The architecture includes two microservices:

1 -  Department Service : Handles operations related to departments.
2 -  User Service: Manages user-related operations. Each user is associated with a department.

# Service Registry

The Service Registry keeps track of all the microservices and their statuses. It provides a system-wide view of all active microservices.

# API Gateway

The API Gateway manages all the requests to the microservices. It acts as a single entry point for all requests, which are then routed to the appropriate microservices.
